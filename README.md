# Fueled Lead FE Engineer Test - Mark Sarkis Ohanesian

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`

## Overview
Thank you for considering my submission for the frontend web developer position. Below, I've outlined the key aspects of my solution in response to the provided assignment instructions.

## Features Implemented
- Editable Title: The title of the questionnaire is fully editable at the top of the page, allowing users to customize it to their preference.
- Dynamic Question Management: Users can add new questions by clicking the "ADD QUESTION" button. Additionally, any question can be deleted by interacting with the provided UI.
- Single Answer Form Type: As per the requirements, I've implemented a single type of answer form, specifically supporting short answer responses.
- JSON Data Output: Clicking on "SAVE & SHARE" triggers the output of a JSON data structure representing the questionnaire viewable in the browser console for easy access and verification. Multiple questions are outputted as arrays.

## Approach
Given that I had a deadline for this assignment, as well as the requirement to not use a UI library, I decided to focus on basic function before implementing all of the design elements, while ensuring accessibilty by using semantic markup and checking for keyboard functionality as I go.
